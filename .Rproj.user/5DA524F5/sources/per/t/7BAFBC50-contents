# Preface {-}


This is a companion webpage for the course ECON30130 Econometrics at University College Dublin (UCD). The website provides students with the opportunity to explore and deepen their knowledge of some of the key concepts covered in the course. I will work a lot with visualisations and dashboards, which should help students to develop intuition about econometric techniques. This is work in progress: over the academic year 2022/23, I will add content as we progress through the course. 
The webpage is a complement to and not a substitute for the textbook, lecture slides or lecture attendance. 

Some key concepts have been explained and visualised much better by other econometrics and statistics teachers. At various parts of the text, I will provide links to relevant webpages. In particular, I recommend the following online textbooks:

- [**Introduction to Econometrics with R**](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/) by Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber and Martin Schmelzer of the University of Duisburg-Essen (Germany). This online textbook teaches R based on the Stock & Watson textbook and provides a wealth of examples and exercises. 
-[ **Introduction to Econometrics with R**](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/) by Florian Oswald, Vincent Viers, Jean-Marc Robin, Pierre Villedieu and Gustave Kenedi of SciencesPo in Paris. These teachers (who are also great researchers btw) created a standalone course in econometrics. All teaching is through R. The textbook contains lots of examples while often going into great detail. 
- For basics of statistics and data science, I highly recommend [**Telling Stories with Data**](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/) by Rohan Alexander. It covers a lot of basic tasks such as collecting, cleaning, storing and visualising data. 


The website has been created by Benjamin Elsner. For any feedback, please email benjamin(dot)elsner(at)ucd.ie.

# About

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Usage 

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```

-->

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
